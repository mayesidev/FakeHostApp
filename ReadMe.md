This application was created to allow "custom" application entries in Discord, without having to add and then rename an application like Notepad.

The console window title is customizable in the App.Config file because the window title is what Discord reads for the application name.

Multiple instances of this application can be running with different window titles, and Discord will detect them as independent applications.
